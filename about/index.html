            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
            I grew up in the small town of 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrum,_Virginia">Ferrum, VA</a>: 
            home to cows, corn, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonshine">moonshine</a>. 
            I attended college at <a target="_blank" href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a>, 
            dual majoring in Computer Science and Math, then earned a Master's in Applied Math at 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a> while working full time
            at The Johns Hopkins <a target="_blank" href="https://jhuapl.edu">Applied Physics Lab</a>. 
            My work at APL mostly focused on sensor integration and exploitation, real-time video and 
            image processing, and tracking algorithms for radar and video.
            </p>
            <p>
            After 4 years in Baltimore, I left the US in early 2015 to explore a bit of the world, living 
            for a year in Mongolia and now stationed in
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi">Tbilisi, Georgia</a>, where I 
            have been since 2016. During this time I have worked remotely in web development, devops, and 
            systems architecture for various startups in the US and abroad.
            </p>
            <p>
            I now focus on contributing to Bitcoin and related projects and consult for companies interested in 
            understanding and utilizing blockchain technology.
            </p>
            <p>When I am not working, I enjoy hiking and exploring the Caucasus Mountains, making natural mead, 
            trying all the food and drink the world has to offer, and sleeping in on rainy days.</b>
