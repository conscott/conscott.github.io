			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I grew up in the rural town of Ferrum, VA among the cows and corn fields. I went to college at Virginia Tech and majored in Computer Science and Math, then got a Masters in Applied Math at Johns Hopkins while working full time at The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab working on sensor exploitation, real-time video and image processing, and tracking algorithms. After 4 years in Baltimore, I began traveling quite a bit, working remotely in web development, devops, and systems architecture. I now live in Tbilisi, Georgia and I am currently working on Bitcoin Core and consulting for companies interested in understand and utilizing blockchain technology.
