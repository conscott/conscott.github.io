            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
            I am an American living in the UK, with a current focus on consulting and
            developing for companies interested in understanding and utilizing blockchain technology.
            In my free time I try to contribute to the development of Bitcoin Core, Lightning Network, and other open source projects
            that I find interesting.
            </p>
            <p>I attended college at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a>,
            dual majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, then earned a Master's in Applied Mathematics at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a> while working full time
            at Johns Hopkins <a target="_blank" href="https://jhuapl.edu">Applied Physics Lab</a>.
            My work there focused on sensor integration and exploitation, real-time video and
            image processing, computer vision, and tracking algorithms for radar and video.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 2015 I set off to explore the world, living and working
            for a year in Mongolia and for three years in
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi">Tbilisi, Georgia</a>.
            During this time I did remote work in web development, devops,
            systems architecture, and project management for various startups in the US and abroad.
            I don't bound myself to any programming stack or role, but thrive when trying to
            solve complex problems.
            </p>
            <p>
            When I am not working I enjoy exploring mountains, making natural mead, and sleeping in on rainy days.
            </p>
            <p>
            Work-life balance is my jam.
            </p>
