            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I grew up in the rural town of Ferrum, VA among the cows and corn fields. I went to college at Virginia Tech and majored in Computer Science and Math, then earned a Masters in Applied Math at Johns Hopkins while working full time at The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. My work mostly focused on sensor exploitation, real-time video and image processing, and tracking algorithms for radar and video. After 4 years in Baltimore, I left the US to travel and explore the world, working remotely in web development, devops, and systems architecture. I am now stationed in the charming city of Tbilisi, Georgia, working on Bitcoin Core and consulting for companies interested in understanding and utilizing blockchain technology.
