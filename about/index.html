        <div class="about">
            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I attended college at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a>, 
            dual majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, then earned a Master's in Applied Mathematics at 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a> while working full time
            at Johns Hopkins <a target="_blank" href="https://jhuapl.edu">Applied Physics Lab</a>. 
            My work there focused on sensor integration and exploitation, real-time video and 
            image processing, computer vision, and tracking algorithms for radar and video. This job took me all over
            the USA, training people to use the software that I helped develop.
            </p>
            <p>
            After 4 years in living in Baltimore, I left the US in early 2015 to explore the world, living 
            for a year in Mongolia and now stationed in
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi">Tbilisi, Georgia</a>, where I 
            have been since 2016. During this time I worked remotely in web development, devops, 
            systems architecture, and project management for various startups in the US and abroad.
            </p>
            <p>
            I now consult for companies interested in understanding and utilizing blockchain technology.
            In my free time I contribute to Bitcoin Core and open source projects that further development
            of The Lightning Network. 
            </p>
            <p>When I am not working I enjoy exploring mountains, making natural mead, and sleeping in on rainy days.
            Work-life balance is my jam.
            </p>
