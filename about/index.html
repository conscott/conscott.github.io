            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hey there. My name is Conor. Here is a byte-sized summary of my life...</p>
            <p>
            I grew up in the small town of 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrum,_Virginia">Ferrum, VA</a>
            , which still holds a special place in my heart. I attended college at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a>, 
            dual majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, then earned a Master's in Applied Mathematics at 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a> while working full time
            at The Johns Hopkins <a target="_blank" href="https://jhuapl.edu">Applied Physics Lab</a>. 
            My work there mostly focused on sensor integration and exploitation, real-time video and 
            image processing, and tracking algorithms for radar and video. This job allowed me to discover a
            lot of America, training people to use the software that I helped develop.
            </p>
            <p>
            After 4 years in Baltimore, I left the US in early 2015 to explore a bit of the world, living 
            for a year in Mongolia and now stationed in
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi">Tbilisi, Georgia</a>, where I 
            have been since 2016. During this time I have worked remotely doing web development, devops, 
            systems architecture, project management, and anything else needed to get the job done for various startups in the US
            and abroad.
            </p>
            <p>
            I now focus on contributing to Bitcoin and other blockchain related projects and consult (and develop)
            for companies interested in understanding and utilizing blockchain technology.
            </p>
            <p>When I am not working I enjoy exploring mountains, making natural mead, eating all the food, and sleeping in on rainy days.
            Work-life balance is my jam.
            </p>
