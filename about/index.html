            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I grew up in the rural town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrum,_Virginia">Ferrum, VA</a> among the cows and corn fields, often walking along the local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail">Appalachain Trail</a> with my family. I attended college at <a href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a> and majored in Computer Science and Math, then earned a Masters in Applied Math at <a href="https://jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a> while working full time at The Johns Hopkins <a href="https://jhuapl.edu">Applied Physics Lab</a>. My work at APL mostly focused on sensor integration and exploitation, real-time video and image processing, and tracking algorithms for radar and video. </p>
            <p>After 4 years in Baltimore, I left the US in early 2015 to explore a bit of the world, living for a year in Mongolia and now stationed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi">Tbilisi, Georgia</a>, where I have been since 2016. During this time I have worked remotely in web development, devops, and systems architecture for various startups in the US and abroad. I now have a focus on Bitcoin Core development and consult for companies interested in understanding and utilizing blockchain technology.
            </p>
            <p>I also love the math, hiking, and craft beer.</b>
