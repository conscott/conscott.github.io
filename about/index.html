        <div class="about">
            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I attended college at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a>,
            dual majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, then earned a Master's in Applied Mathematics at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a> while working full time
            at Johns Hopkins <a target="_blank" href="https://jhuapl.edu">Applied Physics Lab</a>.
            My work focused on sensor integration and exploitation, real-time video and
            image processing, computer vision, and tracking algorithms for radar and video. I also flew all over
            the USA, training military personnel to use the software that our group developed.
            </p>
            <p>
            After 4 years in living in Baltimore, I left the US in early 2015 to explore the world, living (and working)
            for a year in Mongolia and now stationed in
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi">Tbilisi, Georgia</a>, where I
            have been since 2016. During this time I have done remote work in web development, devops,
            systems architecture, and project management for various startups in the US and abroad.
            </p>
            <p>
            I now consult and develop for companies interested in understanding and utilizing blockchain technology.
            In my free time I try to contribute to Bitcoin, lightning network, and other open source projects
            that I find interesting.
            </p>
            <p>When I am not working I enjoy exploring mountains, making natural mead, and sleeping in on rainy days.
            Work-life balance is my jam.
            </p>
